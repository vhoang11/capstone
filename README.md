#PROJECT TITLE
Mend it Like Westwood

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project was motivated by my love of fashion and sustainability. The name comes from a play on "Bend it like Beckham" and the famous fashion designer who was a big champion of sustainable fashion Vivian Westwood. One of her quotes that I love is "Buy less, choose well, make it last". Through this project, I hope to encourage and motivate people to try mending or repairing their existing things instead of throwing it away.

#THE PROBLEM
We have become a throwaway culture which creates increasing amounts of unnecessary waste.
People often experience barriers to mending:
- Don’t have the skill set
- Don’t have time to mend or repair
- Don’t have money to put into repairs or alterations
- Negative stigma associated with repairs
- Endless supply of cheap products
This project focuses on the first barrier, not having the knowledge and skill set. This project encompasses tutorials for apparel, home, and misc.

#FEATURES
- Users will be able to login and logout
- Users will be able to CRUD on tutorials that they create.
- The home page will show the 3 categories: Apparel, Home, and Misc
- There is also a Categories tab on the Navigation bar where users can select the category they want to see
- Each category has tutorials that were created for that category
- Users can create a tutorial from the Nav bar or from the category pages
